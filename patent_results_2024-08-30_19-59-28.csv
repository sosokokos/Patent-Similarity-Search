US10251423B2,Programmable electronic vaporizing apparatus and smoking cessation system,1.07976985,1.07976985,1.07976985,1406,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b1/89/2a/9864b0d9f171a8/US10251423.pdf,"A programmable smoking cessation system includes an electronic vaporizing apparatus system, apparatus, nicotine management plan. Methods for the reduction of nicotine consumption based on the nicotine management plan to reduce or eliminate nicotine dependence. The systems, apparatuses and methods described herein utilize a digital processing device in combination with a vapor release mechanism to vaporize and blend nicotine and non-nicotine liquid substances from cartridge chambers to produce vapors configured to reduce nicotine consumption and dependence at a modulated rate over a specified period of time based on the nicotine management plan. The system and apparatus are configurable to track and report data acquired during use and provide feedback to a user and/or a clinical professional."
US4715387A,Aerosol for use in the reduction of tobacco smoking,1.17618132,1.17618132,1.17618132,136,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/12/49/7c/9c3ef2e8862f21/US4715387.pdf,"A method and an apparatus and composition used in the reduction of the incidence of tobacco smoking and which comprises an aerosol for application to the oral cavity and respiratory tract of an individual. The aerosol contains a food acid, such as citric acid, which is present in non-toxic amounts and capable of being inhaled. The aerosol may be in the form of a liquid spray or a finely divided solid. The droplets or particles contained in the aerosol are of proper size and have the food acid sufficient in content to simulate the sensations in the upper respiratory tract caused by tobacco smoke. In this way, the oral cavity sensations and the respiratory tract sensations simulate those created by tobacco smoke to replace the need for tobacco smoke. In another embodiment of the invention the food acid aerosol contains tobacco smoke of proper particle size so that the food acid particles migrate to the respiratory tract and the tobacco smoke remains in the oral cavity. In still a further embodiment of the invention, the aerosol contains small particles of a carrier such as a saccharide with tobacco smoke adsorbed thereon. In still another embodiment, the aerosol can be used in combination with a transdermal application of nicotine."
